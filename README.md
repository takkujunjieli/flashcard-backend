## TODOs

### Backend

- [ ] Run this branch locally with anythingllm to see if it can successfully generate Q&A
- [ ] Use a bigger model to test this branch
- [ ] Test different prompts for best AI performance
- [ ] Test different pdf files to see if the pdf parsing and flashcard generation are accurate

### Other
